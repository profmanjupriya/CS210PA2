## Programming Assignment 2: Text-Based RPG Using Decision Trees

### **Student Name:** `[Your Name]`  
### **Student ID:** `[Your ID]`  

---

## **1. Project Overview**
(Provide a brief summary of your RPG game. Describe how it uses a decision tree and how the player interacts with it.)

Example:
> This project implements a text-based RPG using a **binary decision tree**. Each game event is represented as a node, and the player progresses by choosing between two paths at each stage. The storyline is loaded from an external text file (`story.txt`), which is parsed to construct the decision tree. The game ends when a leaf node (with `-1` as left and right children) is reached.

---

## **2. Folder & File Structure**
(Explain the role of each file in your project.)

- **`main.cpp`** → `[Describe its function]`  
- **`GameDecisionTree.h`** → `[Explain what this file contains]`  
- **`Node.h`** → `[Explain what this file contains]`  
- **`Story.h`** → `[Explain what this file contains]`  
- **`story.txt`** → `[Explain how the game loads story events from this file]`  

---

## **3. Decision Tree Construction**
(Explain how the decision tree is built from the `story.txt` file.)

- How are `Story` objects created from the text file?  
- How are nodes linked based on left and right event numbers?  
- What happens if an event has `-1` as left or right children?  

---

## **4. Game Traversal**
(Describe how the game moves through the decision tree.)

- How does user input determine the path taken?  
- What happens when the player reaches a leaf node?  
- Explain the special case where multiple events lead to the same outcome.  

---

## **5. File Parsing & Data Loading**
(Explain the process of reading `story.txt` and constructing the decision tree.)

- How is the file read and parsed using a delimiter?  
- How do you ensure nodes are properly linked?  
- Any challenges faced while handling file input?  

---

## **6. Debugging Process (Errors & Fixes)**
(Describe one or more debugging challenges you faced and how you fixed them.)

Example:
> Initially, my program was crashing when trying to access an uninitialized node. I realized it was because I was not properly checking for `nullptr` before accessing child nodes, so I added a check to prevent accessing uninitialized memory.

---

## **7. Sample Output & Walkthrough**
(Provide an example of how the game runs, including player input.)

---

## **8. Big-O Analysis of Core Methods**
(Analyze the complexity of key methods.)

- **Loading the tree from the file** → `O(?)`  
- **Searching for an event in the tree** → `O(?)`  
- **Game traversal efficiency** → `O(?)`  

---

## **9. Edge Cases & Testing**
(Describe at least one edge case you tested and its outcome.)

Example:
> I tested a scenario where the player reaches a dead-end (leaf node) and ensured the program correctly ends the game.

---

## **10. Justification of Additional Features (If Any)**
(If you added extra features, describe them and explain why.)

Example:
> I added a **save/load feature** so players can resume the game later. This was done by writing the current node’s event number to a file and reading it when restarting.

---

## **Final Notes**
- **README is mandatory** → `(-10 points deduction if missing).`  
- **Code must compile and run** → `(Code that does not run will receive a 0).`  
- **Do not modify provided skeleton code** → `(You may only add to it).`
